# PERSONA: The BTS Online Quiz 💜🎤
This project is an interactive, console-based quiz application developed in **C**. It tests the user's knowledge about the globally renowned K-Pop group **BTS** through 20 multiple-choice questions. Each correct answer earns the user **0.5 marks**, and based on the total score, the program assigns an ARMY rank **Baby ARMY**, **Dynamite ARMY**, or **OG ARMY**. The project demonstrates structured programming concepts in C such as **functions**, **loops**, **conditional statements**, and **user input handling**.

## **Getting Started**
When you run the program, you will be shown a series of multiple-choice BTS questions. Each question has four options (A, B, C, D). To answer, simply type the letter of the option you think is correct and press Enter. Your score will be updated automatically after each question, and once all 20 questions are completed, the program will tell you your ARMY rank based on your performance.

## **Build Instructions**
1. Ensure your system has a working C compiler.
2. Place all `.c` files inside the **src** folder and required `.h` files inside **include**.
3. Use the GCC command to compile and generate the executable.
4. Run the output file and interact with the quiz.
